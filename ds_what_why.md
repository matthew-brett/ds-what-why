# The origins of data science

> ... what data scientists do is make discoveries while swimming in data ...
> At ease in the digital realm, they are able to bring structure to large
> quantities of formless data and make analysis possible. ... Data scientists’
> most basic, universal skill is the ability to write code.

# Scientists who were good with data

> Some of the best and brightest data scientists are PhDs in esoteric fields
> like ecology and systems biology. George Roumeliotis, the head of a data
> science team at Intuit in Silicon Valley, holds a doctorate in astrophysics.

# Why did it go wrong?

* The wrong people were designing the courses.
* They missed the big picture.
* The wrong people because:
    * They weren't data scientists themselves
    * They were not training data-focussed researchers.

# How did it go wrong?

* Learn to code, then data science.
* Don't learn to understand code, just use it like a recipe.
* Data science as specialization rather than foundation.

# Greater data science

*  "... embracing a reinvention of statistical education in the era of
   pervasive computation." ([2015 Berkeley faculty report][ds-report-2015]).
* Teaching statistics "assuming computers exist, rather than assuming they
  don't exist." ([John Denero][jd-2018-webinar]).
* "Express in code what we would otherwise express in equations." ([John
  Denero][jd-2018-webinar]).
* "**Visualize First** - represent the data graphically in order to motivate
  questions about inference and concepts of statistics" ([Eric Van
  Dusen][ds-workshop-2019]).

# Berkeley course and beyond

* Data science as foundation for statistics, data analysis and understanding.
* No requirements for foundation course.
* Massive expansion throughout university
* Widely adopted, adapted and emulated
