# The data science revolution in education: a report from the front lines

Talk to the Higher Education Futures Initiative, University of Birmingham, Thursday October 17th 2019, 13:30-15:00.

## Abstract

Data science is a new approach to data analysis, founded in code. It is
transforming undergraduate teaching. Berkeley leads in this; their introductory
course has 1500 undergraduates; the teaching approach has spread across the
University. I describe Berkeley's experience, discuss progress at the
University of Birmingham, and predict a transformation in undergraduate
education.

## Background

Data science is a fundamental method for understanding the modern world of
data, algorithms and networks. A 2018 report from the US National Academies
suggests that all undergraduates should be trained in data science, and the
Berkeley course is for students of all subjects, with no requirements for
programming or mathematics. I will argue from the Berkeley experience, that
data science teaching and methods will cause a radical transformation in
undergraduate education, and that we need to plan for this transformation if we
are to lead in undergraduate education in the UK.

Berkeley's introduction to data science course is called "Foundations of Data Science", or "Data 8".

Their more advanced course is Data 100: Principles and Techniques of Data Science.
